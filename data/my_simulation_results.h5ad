# Placeholder .h5ad file
# This represents the simulation results in AnnData format
# In a real implementation, this would contain actual single-cell data
# with gene expression matrices, metadata, and annotations

# File structure:
# - X: gene expression matrix
# - obs: cell metadata
# - var: gene metadata
# - uns: unstructured data
# - obsm: multi-dimensional cell annotations
# - varm: multi-dimensional gene annotations

# This is a binary HDF5 file containing single-cell RNA-seq data
# Generated from gene editing simulation
